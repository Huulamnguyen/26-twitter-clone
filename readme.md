 ## Twitter Clone

 ### Description
  Warblers are bright and beautiful songbirds, known for their distinctive TWEETS! 
  Twitter is one of the most widely used apps in the world, also known for its distinctive Tweets - however, Twitter's tweets can sound a lot uglier than those of a songbird. 
  In the project linked below, you'll make a clone of Twitter and implement some new functionality

### Goals
  Create a clone of Twitter and add additional functionality
  Practice reading a large codebase and interacting with elements you may be unfamiliar with

### Set up & Run
  Step 1: clone the application at this link https://github.com/Huulamnguyen/26-twitter-clone.git 
  Step 2: create your database name "warble" on PostgreSQL
  Step 3: create virtual environment `python -m vevn venv`
  Step 4: activate virtual environment `source venv/bin/activate`
  Step 5: install all required dependencies `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` (python3) or `pip install -r requirements.txt` (python2)
  Step 6: to run on development mode `export FLASK_ENV=development` then `flask run`

### Testing
  Test User model `python -m unittest test_user_model.py`
  Test User views `python -m unittest test_message_views.py`
  Test Message model `python -m unittest test_message_model.py`
  Test Message views `python -m unittest test_message_views.py`
### Languages/ Framework:
  HTML/CSS
